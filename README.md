    How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
    I can ensure that my code is functional by performing manual and automated tests with a high coverage percentage. To ensure my code is secure I can manually review the code to outline obvious security vulnerabilities. I can also implement secure coding practices and error handling at all stages of development. 
    
    How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
    User needs can come from the software requirements or user stories. Incorporating them into the program is done by first coding the features and then performing different types of testing (regression testing, use case testing, etc.) to ensure they perform the desired actions.
    
    How do I approach designing software?
    I approach software design by building off of the requirements outline and breaking down each step of what the program needs to do. Tackling the project one requirement at a time makes it easier for me to visualize how the parts of the program need to work together and how I should code their interactions.
